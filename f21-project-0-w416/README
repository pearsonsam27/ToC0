CSCI 561 --- Project 0

The purpose of the project is to familiarize you with functional
programming and the Common Lisp development environment.

Please take the time to setup the lisp development environment
(explained below). IF YOU DO NOT SETUP A REASONABLE DEVELOPMENT
ENVIRONMENT, THE OTHER COURSE PROJECTS WILL BE *EXTREMELY* DIFFICULT.

INSTRUCTIONS
============

1. Form groups of 2-4 to work on this project.

2. From the github.com interface for this repo, click `Use this
   template` to import the starter code.  Create a new, private repo
   for your team in the course organization.  Name your repo
   `TYY-project-0-TEAMNAME`, where,
   - `T` is one charcter for the term: `f` Fall or `s` for Spring,
   - `YY` is the two digit year, e.g. `19` for 2019,
   - `TEAMNAME` is a name for your team.

3. Clone the repo.

        git clone git@github.com:mines-csci561/TYY-project-0-TEAMNAME

4. Give all team members access to the team repo in the course github
   organization.

5. Add all team members' names and CWIDs to the `AUTHORS` file.

6. Double-check that (1) your team's github repo is correctly named
   and (2) only your teammates (and the instructor/TA) can access your
   team's github repo.

7. Complete the function stubs in project-0.lisp.

   Use only the following standard Lisp functions, macros, operators,
   and constants in your definitions, along with any previously
   completed functions in this project:

    - T
    - NIL
    - IF
    - WHEN
    - COND
    - NOT
    - AND
    - OR
    - EQUAL
    - CONS
    - LIST
    - CAR
    - CDR
    - FIRST
    - SECOND
    - THIRD
    - LENGTH
    - DEFUN
    - LABELS
    - LET
    - LET*
    - FUNCALL
    - CASE
    - DESTRUCTURING-BIND
    - QUOTE (')
    - ` (backquote / list template)
    - any arithmetic operator or relation (+, -, *, /, <, <=, >, >=, =)
    - any numerical constant

8. Answer the questions in project-0-report.pdf

9.  Push your code changes to your group repo in the course
    organization before the project deadline.  At the project
    deadline, the TA/instructor will download for grading all
    repositories in the course organization beginning with the prefix
    `TYY-project-0-` as described above

10. Submit your report as a PDF on canvas. Include all group members'
    names in the submitted PDF (only one group member needs to
    submit).

LISP ENVIRONMENT SETUP
======================

I strongly recommend that you use SBCL (http://sbcl.org/) and
Emacs/SLIME (https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/) on Linux.

If you are not using Linux as the host operating system on your
computer, you may install Linux in a virtual machine (VM).

You may also use the Isengard server (isengard.mines.edu) and the
Linux workstations in the ALAMODE lab in CT B60.

SBCL Setup
----------
SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp) is high performance Common Lisp system.

On Debian/Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install sbcl

Other platforms: http://sbcl.org/platform-table.html

Quicklisp/SLIME
---------------

Quicklisp is a lisp package manager.

SLIME (the "Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs") provides a
development environment for Common Lisp within Emacs.

    wget https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp
    sbcl --load quicklisp.lisp \
         --eval '(quicklisp-quickstart:install)' \
         --eval '(ql-util:without-prompting (ql:add-to-init-file))' \
         --eval '(ql:quickload "quicklisp-slime-helper")' \
         --eval '(quit)'

The above call to SBCL will print several commands at the end to add
to your ~/.emacs file.  Add these commands to your ~/.emacs file.

Finally, to improve security, set a password for slime connections:

    (umask 077 && openssl rand -base64 14 > ~/.slime-secret)

Submission Instructions
=======================

These submission instructions are intended to promote collaboration
with your teammates, make submitting your code easy, and avoid errors
with incorrect submissions.  Please take care to correctly submit your
work by the deadline.

- Push all changes to your team repo created above in the course
  organization before the deadline.

- The TA/instructor will clone the user repos (based on the repository
  name prefix) at the deadline and grade the code in the master
  branch.

- ONLY CODE THAT IS CORRECTLY SUBMITTED BY THE DEADLINE WILL BE
  GRADED:
  - Ensure that your code is pushed to a correctly named repo in the
    course organization.  Incorrectly named repos will not be graded.
  - Ensure that your code is in the master branch.  Code in other
    branches will not be graded.
  - Submit your code by the deadline.  Late work will not be graded.
  - Keep the same directory structure and function names as in the
    stater code.  The grading scripts will test your code based on the
    directory structure and function names in the starter code.  If
    you change either, your code will not pass the tests, and you will
    not receive credit.
  - Code that does not compile will not receive credit.

Grading
=======

Your code will be run for grading using (approximately) the following
procedure:

    sbcl --load project-0.lisp --load testcases.lisp

Your code needs to produce the correct result to receive credit for
each testcase. Make sure your code loads cleanly without compilation
errors, extra I/O, or other side effects.

FAQ
===

Q: I want to do the project under MacOS X.  What should I do?

A: The above instructions for SLIME under Linux shoulder mostly work
   for MacOS X as well.  You may find one of the MacOS X package
   managers, such as Homebrew or MacPorts, to be convenient for
   installing SBCL and Emacs.

Q: I want to do the project under MS Windows.  What should I do?

A: The instructor and TAs cannot provide support for development on MS
   Windows. Given the advantages and prevalance of Linux in servers,
   the cloud, embedded, mobile, robotics, and supercomputing, it would
   be to your distinct benefit to become comfortable using Linux.
